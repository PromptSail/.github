## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Prompt Sail! 🚀


🙋‍♀️ **Who are we?** 

We're a team of AI enthusiasts who believe in the power of AI and the importance of good engineering practice. We use the LLM's daily, and we want to ensure that all prompts and responses in LLM communication are considered as valuable organizational data. 

💎📊 Did you consider the potential insights and knowledge derived from all your prompt and corresponding responses? We do! 💡🔍


We aim to create transparent and developer-friendly tools for monitoring, analysis, and governance in LLM communication. 🛠️🔍🌐
